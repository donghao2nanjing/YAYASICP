Considering the special case in Exercise 2.71, for a given n, the growth of *compare* steps:
- for the most frequent symbol: O(1), because the most frequent symbols is hit on the first shot.(I have different opinion on this topic with [YASICP]https://gitlab.com/barry.allison/wizard-book-solutions/-/blob/master/ch02/ex2.72.rkt))
- for the least frequent symbol: O(2^n-1), that is O(2^n)
